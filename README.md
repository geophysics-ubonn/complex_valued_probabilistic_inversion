The inversion uses the complex coordinate representation of complex vectors. For the complex vector $\tilde{\mathbf{x}} \in \mathbb{C}^M$ we define $(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}, \bar{\tilde{\mathbf{x}}})^T \in \mathbb{C}^{2M}$ to be its representation in conjugate coordinates, with $\bar{\tilde{x}}$ denoting the complex conjugation and $^T$ denoting the transpose. Input vectors (for example for model and data) have to be formulated accordingly.
